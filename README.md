Overview
========

Welcome to Astronomer! This project was generated after you ran 'astro dev init' using the Astronomer CLI. This readme describes the contents of the project, as well as how to run Apache Airflow on your local machine.

Project Contents
================

Your Astro project contains the following files and folders:

- dags: This folder contains the Python files for your Airflow DAGs. By default, this directory includes one example DAG:
    - `example_astronauts`: This DAG shows a simple ETL pipeline example that queries the list of astronauts currently in space from the Open Notify API and prints a statement for each astronaut. The DAG uses the TaskFlow API to define tasks in Python, and dynamic task mapping to dynamically print a statement for each astronaut. For more on how this DAG works, see our [Getting started tutorial](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/get-started-with-airflow).
- Dockerfile: This file contains a versioned Astro Runtime Docker image that provides a differentiated Airflow experience. If you want to execute other commands or overrides at runtime, specify them here.
- include: This folder contains any additional files that you want to include as part of your project. It is empty by default.
- packages.txt: Install OS-level packages needed for your project by adding them to this file. It is empty by default.
- requirements.txt: Install Python packages needed for your project by adding them to this file. It is empty by default.
- plugins: Add custom or community plugins for your project to this file. It is empty by default.
- airflow_settings.yaml: Use this local-only file to specify Airflow Connections, Variables, and Pools instead of entering them in the Airflow UI as you develop DAGs in this project.

Deploy Your Project Locally
===========================

Start Airflow on your local machine by running 'astro dev start'.

This command will spin up five Docker containers on your machine, each for a different Airflow component:

- Postgres: Airflow's Metadata Database
- Scheduler: The Airflow component responsible for monitoring and triggering tasks
- DAG Processor: The Airflow component responsible for parsing DAGs
- API Server: The Airflow component responsible for serving the Airflow UI and API
- Triggerer: The Airflow component responsible for triggering deferred tasks

When all five containers are ready the command will open the browser to the Airflow UI at http://localhost:8080/. You should also be able to access your Postgres Database at 'localhost:5432/postgres' with username 'postgres' and password 'postgres'.

Note: If you already have either of the above ports allocated, you can either [stop your existing Docker containers or change the port](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/cli/troubleshoot-locally#ports-are-not-available-for-my-local-airflow-webserver).

Deploy Your Project to Astronomer
=================================

If you have an Astronomer account, pushing code to a Deployment on Astronomer is simple. For deploying instructions, refer to Astronomer documentation: https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/deploy-code/

### Project Overview: Airflow ETL Pipeline with Postgres and API Integration
This project involves creating an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Apache Airflow. The pipeline extracts data from an external API (in this case, NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API), transforms the data, and loads it into a Postgres database. The entire workflow is orchestrated by Airflow, a platform that allows scheduling, monitoring, and managing workflows.

The project leverages Docker to run Airflow and Postgres as services, ensuring an isolated and reproducible environment. We also utilize Airflow hooks and operators to handle the ETL process efficiently.

Key Components of the Project:
Airflow for Orchestration:

Airflow is used to define, schedule, and monitor the entire ETL pipeline. It manages task dependencies, ensuring that the process runs sequentially and reliably.
The Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) defines the workflow, which includes tasks like data extraction, transformation, and loading.
Postgres Database:

A PostgreSQL database is used to store the extracted and transformed data.
Postgres is hosted in a Docker container, making it easy to manage and ensuring data persistence through Docker volumes.
We interact with Postgres using Airflow’s PostgresHook and PostgresOperator.
NASA API (Astronomy Picture of the Day):

The external API used in this project is NASA’s APOD API, which provides data about the astronomy picture of the day, including metadata like the title, explanation, and the URL of the image.
We use Airflow’s SimpleHttpOperator to extract data from the API.
Objectives of the Project:
Extract Data:

The pipeline extracts astronomy-related data from NASA’s APOD API on a scheduled basis (daily, in this case).
Transform Data:

Transformations such as filtering or processing the API response are performed to ensure that the data is in a suitable format before being inserted into the database.
Load Data into Postgres:

The transformed data is loaded into a Postgres database. The data can be used for further analysis, reporting, or visualization.
Architecture and Workflow:
The ETL pipeline is orchestrated in Airflow using a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). The pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. Extract (E):
The SimpleHttpOperator is used to make HTTP GET requests to NASA’s APOD API.
The response is in JSON format, containing fields like the title of the picture, the explanation, and the URL to the image.
2. Transform (T):
The extracted JSON data is processed in the transform task using Airflow’s TaskFlow API (with the @task decorator).
This stage involves extracting relevant fields like title, explanation, url, and date and ensuring they are in the correct format for the database.
3. Load (L):
The transformed data is loaded into a Postgres table using PostgresHook.
If the target table doesn’t exist in the Postgres database, it is created automatically as part of the DAG using a create table task.
